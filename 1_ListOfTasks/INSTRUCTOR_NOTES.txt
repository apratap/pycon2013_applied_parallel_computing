MINESH - can you confirm the following questions please?
* Inside the VirtualBox, if you run python and do "import multiprocessing", "print multiprocessing.cpu_count()" does it say 1 or >1 cpus? On my laptop it says 8. On a default VirtualBox it might only say 1 (but you can set more CPUs in the VirtualBox configuration)
* Can you confirm that the examples below (marked "MINESH") all run in the virtualbox? On my laptop the first (serial_python) takes 10 seconds on 1 CPU, the others will all take about the same time (in the class we use more CPUs and more work units and we get it down to 3.1s on my laptop)

MINESH - to confirm that the code runs:
start in: 1_ListOfTasks/solutions/
run the following and confirm you get an output
$ python serial_python.py  # will make a 2D plot with matplotlib
$ python serial_python.py -s 300 -m 100 --plot3D  # will make a 3D surface plot (if you take out "-s 300 -m 100" you'll get a larger plot but it will take 1 minute to draw)
$ python parallelpy.py  # will run on 1 CPU (this is expected)
$ parallelpy_manymachines.py  # will only run if in *another terminal* you run "$ ppserver.py -d -a", this is the over-the-network version


--------

Notes for Ian:

1_mandelbrot_serial
Confirm we have a 2D plot first
Run using:
$ python serial_python.py

Switch to 3D plot and run using a smaller grid e.g.
$ python serial_python.py -s 300 -m 100 --plot3D

2_mandelbrot_multiprocessing
$ python multiproc.py
confirm it runs using num_chunks=1, then increase nbr of chunks
student to copy Ian's example to fill in the missing code

3_mandelbrot_parallelpython
$ python parallelpy.py
confirm it runs using num_chunks=1, then increase

$ python parallelpy_manymachines.py
and in another terminal run:
$ ppserver.py -d -a
so we have autodiscovery enabled

$ python hotq.py --server
will post 10 jobs to Redis, in other terminals run
$ python hotq.py
and each will consume until the jobs run out
